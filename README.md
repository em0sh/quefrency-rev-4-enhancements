Quefrency Keyboard Case Rev. 4 Enhancements
=======================
This repository is forked from keebio's quefrency-case repository.

The purpose of this repository is to offer enhancements to the current Rev. 4 quefrency keyboard.

Enhancements
-------
### Low Profile 3D Print Case
To be used with 5mm length 2mm screw standoffs. Reduces the overall profile of the keyboard and enhances sound. Can be used with foam.



### 60% Right Half Configuration - 60% Rev3 to Rev4 Adapter.stl
To have a 60% right half for Rev. 4, you must use Rev. 3 switch plates.

With the change from Rev. 3 to Rev. 4 of the board, the bottom right in a 60% configuration has changed to a 2x 1.25u + 2x 1u arrangement. This leaves a 14mm gap between the 1.25u and 1u keycaps.

The following adapter will fill this gap. It is sized as a press fit as the variance between 3D printers wouldn't allow this to be sized perfectly. Use sandpaper to reduce the size of the spacer to fit on the two press fit faces (top and bottom).
